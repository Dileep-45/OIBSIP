<p>
	S. Nambi Narayanan (born 12 December 1941) is an Indian aerospace scientist, who worked for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and contributed significantly to Indian space program by developing the Vikas rocket engine. He led the team which acquired technology from the French for the Vikas engine used in the first PSLV that India launched. As a senior official at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), he was in-charge of the cryogenics division. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award, in March 2019.<br><br><br>

	In 1994, he was falsely implicated in an espionage case, arrested and physically tortured in custody. The charges against him were disproven by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in April 1996, and the Supreme Court of India stopped the Kerala government on technical grounds from continuing its investigation. In 2018, the Supreme Court, through the bench of Dipak Misra, awarded Narayanan a compensation of ₹50 lakh (equivalent to ₹57 lakh or US$71,000 in 2020) . The Government of Kerala decided to give him a further ₹1.3 crore (equivalent to ₹1.5 crore or US$190,000 in 2020).<br><br>
<br>

The film Rocketry: The Nambi Effect, based on his life, starring and directed by R. Madhavan, was released in July 2022.<br><br><br>

				<li>	 Nambi Narayanan was born on 12 December 1941 to Tamil Hindu parents in Nagercoil, in the erstwhile Princely state of Travancore (present-day Kanyakumari District). He completed his schooling at Higher Secondary School, Nagercoil. He did his Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai. Narayanan lost his father while pursuing his degree in Madurai.r<br><br></li>

				<li>	After studying mechanical engineering in Madurai, Narayanan started his career in 1966 at ISRO as a technical assistant at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station. He was sent to Princeton University on deputation at Govt expense in 1969. He completed his master's program there in chemical rocket propulsion under professor Luigi Crocco.<br><br></li>

				<li> The first engine, named Vikas, was tested successfully in 1985. An enquiry by the vigilance cell in 1982 was dropped later. R. B. Sreekumar, in his capacity as the commandant of the Central Industrial Security Force unit posted at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, had investigated an allegation of financial manipulation by Narayanan. In 1994, he submitted a request of voluntary resignation a month before his arrest by Kerala police.<br><br></li>

				<li>	On 26 January 2019, he was conferred with the Padma Bhushan award by the Government of India for developing the Vikas rocket engine.<br><br></li>

				<li>	On 30 November 1994, Narayanan was arrested as part of an investigation of alleged espionage, by a team of Kerala police and Intelligence Bureau officials, based on the videographed statements by a colleague that he and Narayanan had received money for transferring drawings and documents of rocket engines to two Maldivian women, Mariam Rasheeda and Fauziyya Hassan, who were suspected to be spies.<br><br></li>

				<li>	In 2021, the Kerala government settled the case filed against it by Narayanan by agreeing to a payment of ₹1.3 crore (US$160,000).

					On 14 Apr 2021 the Supreme Court of India ordered a CBI probe into the involvement of police officers in the conspiracy. Several of the involved police officers filed petitions in different courts in Kerala in which several documents showing transfer of lands between 2004 and 2008 by Narayanan to various CBI officers involved in the investigation, were produced.<br><br></li>
